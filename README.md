# softnerve-ai-internship-book-workflow
Automated Book Publication Workflow — A Streamlit app that fetches book chapters from a URL, lets you manually rewrite (“spin”) them in your own words, and saves each version to demonstrate a human-in-the-loop editorial process. Built for the Softnerve AI Internship assignment. No AI writing used—everything is done manually.
