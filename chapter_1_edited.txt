The threat to Katafa was a constant presence—more than anything else—and it had not lessened.

One day, they would arrive. Palm Tree's vision echoed what his instincts warned him about. These men would craft canoes, guided by the lagoon's reflection in the sky, and come to the island. They lacked women, but here there were women, and just as Dick felt drawn to Katafa, the men would be drawn to Karolin’s women. They would scan the horizon looking for islands to raid, chasing the light of the lagoon as a beacon.

If only he had realized that danger did not come solely from the north, but from wherever greed, desire, or hate roamed the blue sea—not just from savages, but from the wolves of civilization as well.

For Dick, the world beyond the water encircling the two islands did not exist: no Europe, no America, no history beyond the span of his and Katafa's lives. Yet even in that short life, he had learned to fear mankind and had come to understand the root of all history—man’s instinct for war, plunder, and destruction.

Gradually, the vision of Palm Tree faded and vanished like a blown-out light. As they turned from the sea back toward the lagoon, Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.
